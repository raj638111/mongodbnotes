-- Nodemon

  # Helps to restart mocha completely everytime a file changes ( so that we do not have to manually run the tests)

-- Syntax
 
  # 6_30
  # nodemon --exec 'mocha -R min'
    + Any time a file in the project changes, nodemon will run the command 'mocha -R min'
    + -R min : Condense down the test output & also clears out the output from previous run
